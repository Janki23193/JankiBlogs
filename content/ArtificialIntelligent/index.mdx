 Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has been a tedious task that required a keen eye for typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.

By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you really are just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.

We even included table styles, check it out:

| Wrestler                | Origin       | Finisher           |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Bret "The Hitman" Hart  | Calgary, AB  | Sharpshooter       |
| Stone Cold Steve Austin | Austin, TX   | Stone Cold Stunner |
| Randy Savage            | Sarasota, FL | Elbow Drop         |
| Vader                   | Boulder, CO  | Vader Bomb         |
| Razor Ramon             | Chuluota, FL | Razor's Edge       |


It's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:

1.  We want everything to look good out of the box.
2.  Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.
3.  Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.

 ### What about nested lists?

 We also need to make sure inline code looks good, like if I wanted to talk about `<span>` elements or tell you the good news about `@tailwindcss/typography`.

### Sometimes I even use `code` in headings

Even though it's probably a bad idea, and historically I've had a hard time making it look good. This _"wrap the code blocks in backticks"_ trick works pretty well though really.

Another thing I've done in the past is put a `code` tag inside of a link, like if I wanted to tell you about the [`tailwindcss/docs`](https://github.com/tailwindcss/docs) repository. I don't love that there is an underline below the backticks but it is absolutely not worth the madness it would require to avoid it.

#### We haven't used an `h4` yet

But now we have. Please don't use `h5` or `h6` in your content, Medium only supports two heading levels for a reason, you animals. I honestly considered using a `before` pseudo-element to scream at you if you use an `h5` or `h6`.

We don't style them at all out of the box because `h4` elements are already so small that they are the same size as the body copy. What are we supposed to do with an `h5`, make it _smaller_ than the body copy? No thanks.

### We still need to think about stacked headings though.
