### Brief Overview
 JavaScript has become an indispensable part of the modern web development, 
 offering a vast ecosystem of frameworks and libraries. Among the most prominent 
 front-end technologies are <strong>React.js and Next.js</strong>, both widely used for 
 building dynamic, high-performance web applications. 
 The right technology stack plays a <strong> a critical role in project efficiency, scalability 
 and long-term success </strong> <br/><br/>
  In this blog, we will explore an <strong>in-depth</strong> comparison of React.js and Next.js, highlighting their 
  <strong> key differences, strengths and ideal use cases.</strong> 
 By the end, you'll gain <strong> a clearer understanding </strong> of which technology best aligns with 
 your development goals.


### Introduction: Why This comparison matters
With an abundance of web development technologies available, <strong> choosing between React.js and Next.js can be challenging.</strong>
 Both have gained widespread popularity, yet they cater to different development needs.
While React.js <strong>empowers developers to build interactive UIs with client-side rendering (CSR)</strong>, Next.js 
<strong>enhances React with server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and other advanced features.</strong>
Understanding these differences is <strong>key</strong> to selecting the right tool for your project.
A knowledgeable developer doesn't just pick a frameworkâ€”they choose a 
<strong> solution that enhances performance, optimizes scalability, and improves user experience.</strong>
### What is React.js?

React.js is a javascript library developed by Facebook(now Meta) for building interactive user interfaces. 
Functional programming is also Supported by React. 
> React is primarily used to build Single Page Applications(SPAs) using Client-Side Rendering (CSR), 
where content updates dynamically without full page refresh, improving performance for interactive web apps.


ðŸ”¹ It allows developers to create <strong>reusable UI components</strong>, leading to better <strong>maintainability and scalability</strong>. UI is a mixture of <strong> HTML and JavaScript code</strong> 
which is called JSX(JavaScript XML). JSX is a bit stricter than HTML, it needs to be closed like `<br/>`. 
UI component can be as small as button and as large as entire page. Components can not have multiple JSX, rather must be wrapped into `<div> </div>`
 or `<></>` tags <br/>
ðŸ”¹Virtual DOM & Reconciliation<br/>
React.js introduces a <strong>Virtual DOM(VDOM)</strong> which is <strong>in-memory representation</strong> of a </br/>
real DOM.Rather than directly modifying the real DOM, React updates the virtual DOM First. 
ðŸ”¹ How it works? <br/>
  1. When component's props or state is changes, React creates a new virtual DOM.

Some popular applications built with React include:<br/>
âœ” Netflix <br/>
âœ” Facebook <br/>
âœ” Airbnb <br/>

### What is Single Page Application(SPA) ?
In traditional web development, each page has a seperate template that is sent to the user when requested.
For example, if a user <strong> requests the "About Us" Page</strong>, the server sends back an entirely
new HTML page which can <strong> degrade the performance </strong> - especially for complex websites. <br/>
<strong>SPAs(Single Page Applications)</strong> solve this problem by using 
<strong>a single HTML template</strong> that dynamically updates content without 
requiring an entire page refresh. <br/>
ðŸ”¹ Instead of reloading an entire page, SPAs <strong>update specific components</strong> within 
<strong>DOM(Document Object <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Model).</strong> <br/>
ðŸ”¹ While the term <strong>"Single Page Application"</strong> might suggest that there is only one page, the reality
 is that<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the <strong> entire application is dynamically rendered using JavaScript.</strong>

### What is Next.js?
Next.js is an open source 

### React.js vs Next.js : Key Differences


> By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you really are just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.

We even included table styles, check it out:

| Points                  | React.js     | Next.js            |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Bret "The Hitman" Hart  | Calgary, AB  | Sharpshooter       |
| Stone Cold Steve Austin | Austin, TX   | Stone Cold Stunner |
| Randy Savage            | Sarasota, FL | Elbow Drop         |
| Vader                   | Boulder, CO  | Vader Bomb         |
| Razor Ramon             | Chuluota, FL | Razor's Edge       |


It's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:

1.  We want everything to look good out of the box.
2.  Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.
3.  Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.

 ### What about nested lists?



### Sometimes I even use `code` in headings



#### We haven't used an `h4` yet

But now we have. Please don't use `h5` or `h6` in your content, Medium only supports two heading levels for a reason, you animals. I honestly considered using a `before` pseudo-element to scream at you if you use an `h5` or `h6`.

We don't style them at all out of the box because `h4` elements are already so small that they are the same size as the body copy. What are we supposed to do with an `h5`, make it _smaller_ than the body copy? No thanks.

### We still need to think about stacked headings though.

``` Html showLineNumbers {1-2,4} /Krishna/ title="index.html" caption="this is the supreme power"
<article className="prose">
<p>Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare
Krishna is the supreme personality of GodHead and Radha Rani is the Queen of Krishna or heart of Krishna
She is Vrindavaneshwari</p>
</article>
```
