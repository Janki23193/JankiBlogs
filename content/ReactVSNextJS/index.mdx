### Brief Overview
 JavaScript has become an indispensable part of the modern web development, 
 offering a vast ecosystem of frameworks and libraries. Among the most prominent 
 front-end technologies are <strong>React.js and Next.js</strong>, both widely used for 
 building dynamic, high-performance web applications.  
 The right technology stack plays a <strong> a critical role in project efficiency, scalability 
 and long-term success </strong> <br/>
  In this blog, we will explore an <strong>in-depth</strong> comparison of React.js and Next.js, highlighting their 
  <strong> key differences, strengths and ideal use cases.</strong> 
 By the end, you'll gain <strong> a clearer understanding </strong> of which technology best aligns with 
 your development goals.


### Introduction: Why This comparison matters
With an abundance of web development technologies available, <strong> choosing between React.js and Next.js can be challenging.</strong>
 Both have gained widespread popularity, yet they cater to different development needs.
While React.js <strong>empowers developers to build interactive UIs with client-side rendering (CSR)</strong>, Next.js 
<strong>enhances React with server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and other advanced features.</strong>
Understanding these differences is <strong>key</strong> to selecting the right tool for your project.
A knowledgeable developer doesn't just pick a frameworkâ€”they choose a 
<strong> solution that enhances performance, optimizes scalability, and improves user experience.</strong>
### What is React.js?

React.js is a javascript library developed by Facebook(now Meta) for building interactive user interfaces.
> "React is primarily used to build Single Page Applications(SPAs) using Client-Side Rendering (CSR), 
where content updates dynamically without full page reloads, improving performance for interactive web apps."

ðŸ”¹ It allows developers to create <strong>reusable UI components</strong>, leading to better <strong>maintainability and scalability</strong>. <br/>

Some popular applications built with React include:<br/>
âœ” Netflix <br/>
âœ” Facebook <br/>
âœ” Airbnb <br/>

### What is Single Page Application(SPA) ?
Traditional websites load a new page from the server for each request, which can <strong>unravel performance.</strong> 
In contrast, <strong> SPAs  </strong>  use a single HTML template and update content dynamically using JavaScript,
eliminating full page reloads. This improves speed and user experience, making them ideal for modern web applications.

### What is Next.js?


### React.js vs Next.js : Key Differences


> By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you really are just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.

We even included table styles, check it out:

| Points                  | React.js     | Next.js            |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Bret "The Hitman" Hart  | Calgary, AB  | Sharpshooter       |
| Stone Cold Steve Austin | Austin, TX   | Stone Cold Stunner |
| Randy Savage            | Sarasota, FL | Elbow Drop         |
| Vader                   | Boulder, CO  | Vader Bomb         |
| Razor Ramon             | Chuluota, FL | Razor's Edge       |


It's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:

1.  We want everything to look good out of the box.
2.  Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.
3.  Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.

 ### What about nested lists?

 We also need to make sure inline code looks good, like if I wanted to talk about `<span>` elements or tell you the good news about `@tailwindcss/typography`.

### Sometimes I even use `code` in headings

Even though it's probably a bad idea, and historically I've had a hard time making it look good. This _"wrap the code blocks in backticks"_ trick works pretty well though really.

Another thing I've done in the past is put a `code` tag inside of a link, like if I wanted to tell you about the  repository. I don't love that there is an underline below the backticks but it is absolutely not worth the madness it would require to avoid it.

#### We haven't used an `h4` yet

But now we have. Please don't use `h5` or `h6` in your content, Medium only supports two heading levels for a reason, you animals. I honestly considered using a `before` pseudo-element to scream at you if you use an `h5` or `h6`.

We don't style them at all out of the box because `h4` elements are already so small that they are the same size as the body copy. What are we supposed to do with an `h5`, make it _smaller_ than the body copy? No thanks.

### We still need to think about stacked headings though.

``` Html showLineNumbers {1-2,4} /Krishna/ title="index.html" caption="this is the supreme power"
<article className="prose">
<p>Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare
Krishna is the supreme personality of GodHead and Radha Rani is the Queen of Krishna or heart of Krishna
She is Vrindavaneshwari</p>
</article>
```
