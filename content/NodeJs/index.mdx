### Introduction:
Node.js or node is an open source and cross platform runtime environment  for executing JavaScript Code outdide 
the browser People often use the Node to build back-end services which is called API(Application Programming Interface) 
which is connected to Client applications like Web App or Mobile App which can be seen to users only and 
theese apps might need to interact with servers or cloud services in order to store or fetct something from the Database
or for sending emails or Push notification. Node is the highly-scalable, data-intensive and real time apps for our Client apps.

### Features of Node / why it's so important
1. Great for prototyping and agile development
2. Superfast and highly scalable service like Uber, NetFlix, PayPal. WalMart companies have used it. In fact, they have 
experimented by replacing an app built in Java and Spring into Node App and they have come up with the tremendous 
results which are as follows,
Built twice as fast with fewer People,
33% fewer lines of code,
40% fewer files.
2x request/sec
35% faster response time  
3. JavaScript everywhere 
 it uses javascript so if we know JavaScript well then we can leverage that skill here and this way 
 it can be converted into the full stack web app
4. Cleaner and more consistent codebase
 because we use JavaScript for both frontend and backend so codebase would be more cleaner and consize
 5. Large ecosystem of open-source libs 
   some libraries are readily available for free to use so we can more focus on the real application logic.

   Architecture of Node js
   Js code can behave differntly on different browser because different browser using different versions but browser provides a runtime environment 
   for the JavaScript. JavaScript code was running in the browser from 1970 to 2009 and that was the only way until Founder of Node Ryan Dahl thought of
   running JavaScript outside the browser. Therefore he took the Chrome's v8 engine which is fast JavaScript Engine 
   and embedded into the c++ and gave it a name called Node. This Node.exe is a run time environment for JavaScript code and It
   has a javascript engine which runs the JavaScript code. Developers like to compare C#, Ruby with Node which is 
   because they forget that Node is not a programming language. Also, they should not compare it with ASP.NET

   Node is not a framework and It's a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code

   ### How Node works
    Node applications are asynchronous by default. Node is an Ideal for I/O-Intensive Apps. It muat not be used for CPU-Intensive Apps Video,
    Coding and Image Manipulation because it requires calculation which is done by CPU and some operation Touched File system and Networking.

    Node is a single threaded application so While serving First client request another client must need to wait 
    until calculations are done for the first client request. That's the reason why Node can not be used for CPU-intensive Apps.
    Rather it should be used for Data-intensive and real time applications.

    Practical or write some code
    Node is a C++ programm and uses V8 JS version of Chrome
