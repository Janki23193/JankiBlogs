### What is ReactJS?

React.js is a javascript library developed by Facebook(now Meta) for building interactive user interfaces
It provides tools and structure that make web development faster and more efficient. <br/>
ðŸ”¹ React is primarily used to build Single Page Applications(SPAs) and focuses on the Client-Side <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rendering(CSR) <br/>
ðŸ”¹ It allows developers to create reusable UI components, leading to better maintainability and scalability. <br/>

Some popular applications built with React include:<br/>
âœ” Netflix <br/>
âœ” Facebook <br/>
âœ” Airbnb <br/>

### What is Single Page Application(SPA) ?
In traditional web development, each page has a seperate template that is sent to the user when requested.
For example, if a user <strong> requests the "About Us" Page</strong>, the server sends back an entirely
new HTML page which can <strong> degrade the performance </strong> - especially for complex websites. <br/>
<strong>SPAs(Single Page Applications)</strong> unravel this complexity by using 
<strong>a single HTML template</strong> that dynamically updates content without 
requiring an entire page reload. <br/>
ðŸ”¹ Instead of reloading an entire page, SPAs <strong>update specific components</strong> within 
<strong>DOM(Document Object <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Model).</strong> <br/>
ðŸ”¹ While the term <strong>"Single Page Application"</strong> might suggest that there is only one page, the reality
 is that<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the <strong> entire application is dynamically rendered using JavaScript.</strong>
